# Parcelable-Login-App
This app shows a register activity which asks you to register yourself. Your username and password is saved as an object.
The object is then sent to the login screen using the Parcelable interface which is signifincatly faster than the serialise interface.
You log in with your details. The wrong details results in a toast message. When the details are right, you are brought to a welcome activity
